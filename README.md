# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:

### Notes:

 - Add next configuration in /node_modules/react-native-vector-icons/fonts.gradle if there is an error with the dependencie.

    android.applicationVariants.all { def variant ->
        def targetName = variant.name.capitalize()

        def lintAnalyzeDebugTask = tasks.findByName("lintAnalyzeDebug")
        if (lintAnalyzeDebugTask) {
            lintAnalyzeDebugTask.dependsOn(fontCopyTask)
            lintAnalyzeDebugTask.mustRunAfter(fontCopyTask)
        }

        def lintVitalAnalyzeReleaseTask = tasks.findByName("lintVitalAnalyzeRelease")
        if (lintVitalAnalyzeReleaseTask) {
            lintVitalAnalyzeReleaseTask.dependsOn(fontCopyTask)
            lintVitalAnalyzeReleaseTask.mustRunAfter(fontCopyTask)
        }

        def generateAssetsTask = tasks.findByName("generate${targetName}Assets")
        generateAssetsTask.dependsOn(fontCopyTask)
    }
